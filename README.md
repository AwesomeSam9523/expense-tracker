## App flow

### 1. Login
Login page will have 3 buttons- `EC`, `CC` and `JC`. 
The user will select their level, enter the password and login.

### 2. Allocating budget
The ECs can create a new event and allocate a particular budget. This budget will be available
for the CCs and JCs to use. 

### 3. Submitting an invoice
Any CC or JC can submit an invoice. Submitting is as simple as uploading a picture of the bill
and entering the amount. The invoice will go into a pending state which must first be verified
by a CC or EC.

### 4. Verifying an invoice
Once a CC or EC verifies an invoice the amount gets deducted from the allocated budget.

### 5. Getting a summary
The ECs can get a total summary on all the expenses. Stats regarding money spent on each category
and by whom are easily available.
